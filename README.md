# Fuzzy Logic Controller-Based MPPT for Solar PV Arrays

## üåû Overview
This repository contains a MATLAB/Simulink model for a **Fuzzy Logic Controller-Based Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) algorithm** designed to enhance the efficiency of solar photovoltaic (PV) systems. The model dynamically adjusts the duty cycle of a DC-DC converter to ensure maximum power extraction under varying environmental conditions.

## üìå Features
- **Intelligent MPPT Algorithm**: Utilizes fuzzy logic rules for real-time power optimization.
- **Fast Convergence**: Superior tracking speed compared to traditional MPPT techniques (P&O, Incremental Conductance).
- **Handles Partial Shading**: Efficient in non-uniform irradiance conditions.
- **MATLAB/Simulink Implementation**: Fully modeled and tested in a simulation environment.
- **Improved Efficiency**: Reduces steady-state oscillations and enhances energy harvesting.

## üõ† Requirements
- **MATLAB/Simulink** (R2021a or later recommended)
- Fuzzy Logic Toolbox
- Simscape Power Systems Toolbox (optional but recommended for advanced simulations)

## üöÄ Installation & Usage
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/avulanitheesh/Fuzzy-MPPT-Solar.git
   ```
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the project folder.
3. Open `Fuzzy_MPPT_Simulation.slx` in Simulink.
4. Run the simulation and observe the MPPT performance.
```

## üìä Performance Comparison
| MPPT Method | Tracking Efficiency (%) | Steady-State Oscillations |
|------------|------------------------|--------------------------|
| P&O        | ~92%                   | Moderate                 |
| INC        | ~94%                   | Low                      |
| **Fuzzy MPPT** | **98%**                 | **Minimal**                 |
